    message: 'My name is Jared Griffin. I\'m a junior in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. Through side projects that I\'ve worked on with my friends and my apprenticeships, I\'ve became a fluent web developer with experience working on the entire stack. I have also invested a lot of time in becoming a great leader, serving as President of Iowa State\'s student branch of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and as a member of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department\'s Student Advisory Committee. When I\'m not knee-deep in projects, I\'m probably playing video games or disc golf with friends.'

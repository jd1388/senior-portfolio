    title: 'Hello!',
    message: 'My name is Jared Griffin. I\'m a junior in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. Through side projects that I\'ve worked on with my friends and my apprenticeships, I\'ve became a fluent web developer with experience working on the entire stack. I have also invested a lot of time in becoming a great leader, serving as President of Iowa State\'s student branch of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and as a member of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department\'s Student Advisory Committee. When I\'m not knee-deep in projects, I\'m probably playing video games or disc golf with friends.',
    goals: 'Once I graduate, I will be joining the growing software industry in Des Moines, IA. As my career continues, I want to continue to learn and have an impact on what I do. I want to continue to participate in the Des Moines tech community by attending user groups and conferences with the goal of speaking at them, as well as helping with STEM outreach in the area. Professionally, I want to become an expert in my craft and a resource my teammates can depend on.'

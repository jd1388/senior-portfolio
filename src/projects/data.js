        description: 'For Senior Design at Iowa State, I am working on a project that collects data about an elderly resident going about their day. The goal of this project is to be able to use this data to predict the resident’s future health. With these predictions, our system can alert family members and caretakers to any issues arising in hope of prolonging the life of the elderly resident. For this project, I am taking the lead on our web application’s development. Our web app is developed using React, and it lives on AWS along with the rest of our cloud infrastructure.'

        description: 'Terra is a platform for users to post services that they need done at their residences (lawncare, snow removal, etc.). After a user makes a post, another user can complete the tasks in the post, then get paid through Terra. Currently I\'m working on this project with a group of friends. We are currently working on the first iteration of the project, which consists of users being able to create postings that other users can complete. The only services that we will handle initially is lawncare, but we will slowly add other services. I\'m responsible for the frontend design. I\'ve set up the Terra frontend to use React, and we use Redux for handling client-side data.'

        description: 'I was with a few friends when they started talking about bubble wrap. One of them mentioned that they couldn\'t believe that there wasn\'t a cookie clicker-like game for bubble wrap. So I broke out the laptop and made it happen. In the process of making the game, I learned some practical skills like how to store a cookie on a user\'s browser and how to create images. This was also the first website I tried to turn into a progressive web app.'

        name: 'Giphy Search',
        description: 'I created Giphy Search because I wanted to try some new React features, and I have wanted to try using a public API extensively for some time. My friends like their memes, so I had a group of people who could ask for features. Thus Giphy Search was born. Giphy Search wraps the Giphy API, specifically their search, trending, and random APIs.'

        description: 'This is a project that I led for one of my classes. The goal of Code Couch was to build a platform that mixed together aspects of GitHub, Trello, LinkedIn, and StackOverflow in a single website. The project was built using React and Redux for the frontend and had a Node Express backend.'

        name: 'WalkMeHome',
        description: 'This is another project that I did for one of my classes. The idea behind WalkMeHome as to have a navigation app that would allow someone to "walk you home". The way we did this was having one of the user\'s friends on the app watch their progress while walking to their destination. This way, the user could walk knowing that if they stopped suddenly, someone would know that something wasn\'t right. We built our app using React Native, and the backend for it was built with Node Express.'

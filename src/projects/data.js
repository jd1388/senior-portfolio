        description: 'Terra is a platform for users to post services that they need done at their residences (lawncare, snow removal, etc.). After a user makes a post, another user can complete the tasks in the post, then get paid through Terra. Currently I\'m working on this project with a group of friends. We are currently working on the first iteration of the project, which consists of users being able to create postings that other users can complete. The only services that we will handle initially is lawncare, but we will slowly add other services. I\'m responsible for the frontend design. I\'ve set up the Terra frontend to use React, and we use Redux for handling client-side data.'

        description: 'I was with a few friends when they started talking about bubble wrap. One of them mentioned that they couldn\'t believe that there wasn\'t a cookie clicker-like game for bubble wrap. So I broke out the laptop and made it happen. In the process of making the game, I learned some practical skills like how to store a cookie on a user\'s browser and how to create images. This was also the first website I tried to turn into a progressive web app.'

My friends like their memes, so I had a group of people who could ask for features. Thus Giphy Search was born. Giphy Search wraps the Giphy API, specifically their search, trending, and random APIs.'

The goal of Code Couch was to build a platform that mixed together aspects of GitHub, Trello, LinkedIn, and StackOverflow in a single website. The project was built using React and Redux for the frontend and had a Node Express backend.'

        description: 'This is another project that I did for one of my classes. The idea behind WalkMeHome as to have a navigation app that would allow someone to "walk you home". The way we did this was having one of the user\'s friends on the app watch their progress while walking to their destination. This way, the user could walk knowing that if they stopped suddenly, someone would know that something wasn\'t right. We built our app using React Native, and the backend for it was built with Node Express.'
